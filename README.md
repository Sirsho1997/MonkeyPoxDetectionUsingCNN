# MonkeyPoxDetectionUsingCNN
Distinguishing the Monkeypox cases from the similar Non-Monkeypox cases using lesion images
- Worked with the Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nafin59/monkeypox-skin-lesion-dataset); the original dataset contains a total of 4251 images
(Monkey Pox: 1831, Others: 2420) which also includes augmented images generated by using methods such as rotation,
translation, reflection, shear, hue, saturation, contrast, brightness jitter, noise, scaling, etc. You can download the dataset directly by cloning [this](https://github.com/Sirsho1997/MonkeyPoxDetectionUsingCNN) repository.
- Implemented a ResNet9 architecture( a small ResNet architecture); it is a series of convolutional blocks that encapsulate
a convolutional layer, normalization of the data, and a nonlinear activation function (ReLU). Additionally, the last layer
is a max pooling layer, which determines whether the image is of a monkey pox lesion or some other disease.
- Also utilized the PyTorch’s own implementation of pretrained Resnet34, which is a 34-layer convolutional neural
network. However, the last layer is replaced with a simple linear layer with the output size that equals the number of
classes in our dataset (i.e. 2 for our case)
- Both of the networks implemented used the Weight Decay Regularization technique and the Adam Optimizer; Accuracy
is used as the metric for comparing the models performance.
- ResNet9 provided the best accuracy 93%, for a train:val:test ratio 80:10:10, and ResNet34 provided the best validation
accuracy of 99%
◦ Python libraries used: PyTorch, and Matplotlib.
